    /*
    Encapsulation (ie.: private filed) allows you to protect the values of methods/fields from being overwritten (think
    about the example of a game with a Player that has a lives field, if it has 5 lives to begin with and through the game
    it loses all its lives, you don't want someone "cheating" and reset number of lives to infinity lets say).
    Also if you have a field that's public inside of a class, if you want to rename that field for w/e reason, if now you
    rename that field, it'll break anything that uses that name (imagine if it's used as a library by external applications)
