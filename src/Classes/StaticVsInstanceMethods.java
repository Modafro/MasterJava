    If you have a method inside a class that doesn't require any of the instances of the class, it probably should be a static method.
    A method that uses fields of the class or instance methods then it should be an instance method (i.e: will need class initialization "new").
    Refer to picture attached "instanceVsStaticMethods.png"
